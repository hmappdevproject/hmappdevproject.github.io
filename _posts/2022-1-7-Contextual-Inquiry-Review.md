## Summary
Through our observations and subsequent interviews, we realize a few key points surrounding the topic of convenience, or rather inconvenience, at Horace Mann School. The first finding has to do with the connection between time, convenience, and stress. With only five minutes of passing time, boatloads of work to do, and small tasks, like printing or getting a snack not possible in that time, the small tasks build up to a bigger task at the end of the day. This feels like even more work for our subjects, ultimately leading to more stress than solely school work would give. Second, location plays a large part in this issue. Things at Horace Mann are very far away, and this trend has only been amplified by the closing of the field in the winter. The library and cafeteria are on opposite sides of the school, and not even extremely close to classes. The time it takes to get from class to class is already filling up our passing time, and there is no hope to get the small things done or go get a snack. Even during break or their lunch periods, the trend holds, with students opting to save ten minutes of walking and do work rather than eating. Third and finally, these inconveniences, when they build up and form stress, lead to reduced community engagement. Our subjects reported that they often skipped snacks at break or reduced their time in the cafeteria to get work done or tasks they could not during passing time. This is problematic since break is a time where the entire Horace Mann Upper Division gets together and often does community events planned by the Happiness Club and the Cafeteria serves much of the same role.

## The Inquiry Participants

#### Inquiry 1

In our first inquiry, we observed and then interviewed a Horace Mann Junior by the pseudonym of Heisenberg. We chose them because they take a very rigorous course load, and we believed this would give us insight into how convenience impacted the allocation of his time. The inquiry, which took place in the Katz Library as the subject was doing work, went very well, with the subject being compliant and giving us many useful insights about their experiences. Specifically, we learned that eating is very difficult for Heisenberg. They often take time in the library to do their work rather than eating lunch or snack during break, citing the closed field and stress as drivers of this problem. Heisenberg also said that if food in the library was available he would eat and do work at the same time, but the pandemic has driven that more convenient option out of the window.

#### Inquiry 2

In our second inquiry, we observed and then interviewed a Horace Mann Freshman by the pseudonym of Bob. We chose this participant since we believed that, in contrast to Heisenberg, they would give a response and demonstrate problems with conviction as it pertains to more social rather than academic issues. In this prediction, we were spot on. The contextual inquiry took place in Friedman Hall, where many members of their grade eat lunch. The process went smoothly, and overall we figured out a lot about lunch at Horace Mann. Bob wants to socialize, but through his struggles Bob believes that the Horace Mann community can in the area of location, the field being covered not helping. It takes a really long time for Bob to get from place to place, especially when they do not have much time in between classes, and most importantly on days where they have labs in science. They want to socialize, but instead, they have to squeeze in time to get food and walk a good amount to get to the cafeteria, eat, and get back in time after that.

#### Inquiry 3

In our third inquiry, we interviewed a member of the faculty at Horace Mann by the pseudonym of Patrick Star. We chose to interview this participant because of their experience with inconvenience due to the location of their office and classrooms, in the basement of Tillinghast. This kind of inquiry gave us a special insight into convenience at HM regarding not only location but how it can affect faculty members just as much as students. Mr. Star mentioned the long walk to lunch, but also the proximity to the entrance nearest to the subway, which our participant uses to get to work every day. It is hard to say for our participant whether the pros outweigh the cons or vice versa. Another aspect of this location that Mr. Star put emphasis on was the fact that everybody there has a reason to be there. This creates a community that Mr. Star really enjoys and can interact with nicely on a daily basis.

## Process and Themes

During our inquiries, we used both an “observe and then ask” method and traditional interviews with our participants. In our “observe and ask” method, we would first ask a participant to meet and set a time and location, with the intent of getting there early. That allowed us to observe the subject in an environment of our choice, seeing their natural responses to issues of convenience. After we observe until the designated time, we would then have a conversation and ask questions relating to the topic of convenience, going deeper when we found a potential problem area that we may want to design for. Overall, this went very well, with the interviews after the observations still feeling natural and not forced. Some of the large themes we found included eating, stress, and location. For the first, many of our respondents spoke to how eating, whether during break or in the cafeteria, was difficult for a variety of reasons. This is an important problem area since nutrition is key to mental and physical health and one that may be possible to design for. The second theme, of stress, was talked about in relation to convenience mostly by older students. With heavy workloads, anything inconvenient is hard to do in the limited amount of free time a student has, piling on more work and thus stress for our students. Not eating enough only amplifies these effects, so solving for either problem can help with the mental health of students. Finally, location was mentioned by all of our subjects. The field closure during the winter was very problematic given the small amount of passing time we get, and overall large distances made things like printing hard for students and getting to lunch inconvenient for teachers in specific locations. However, for faculty that spend most of their time in one location, the impact is not as large, and being far from lunch may mean being close to the subway. These themes found in our contextual inquiries will surely serve as guides for what our group tries to do with our project and how we try to address the issue of community engagement at Horace Mann School through the lens of convenience.
