#### Team Contract Section Outline

Preliminary Information: Who is in the team, what are their schedules like, any extracurricular commitments requiring extra time, what are everyone’s skill sets, what are people’s general goals with respect to this course and project?

We are a team that focuses on convenience (?) at Horace Mann School through the lens of app development. We have schedules that go from A-H period and extracurriculars some I periods. We have wonderful HM backed skill sets, and we have the goal of making Horace Mann School a better place in terms of community engagement and develop a great application in the process.

##### Guiding Principles: What is the team’s philosophy? What are some ground rules everyone can agree on? What is your mission

In terms of philosophy, we believe that a positive and supportive group environment will better help us do amazing work for the horace mann community. Our mission is to create a more convenient environment in Horace Mann that will better the lifestyle of students and increase community engagement and action. Some ground rules we can all agree on is that we won’t bully the freshman in our group and work evenly on the project. We will also work on not only giving positive feedback but also constructive criticism.

##### Focus on Purpose: What is the purpose of your project? What is your goal – as you begin your project now, what would you like to have accomplished by the end of this project?

The purpose of our project is to help people work together in order to improve the everyday lives of students and facilitate community engagement though everyday convenience.

###### Group Roles: Can be specifically defined for each person or can be general and open-ended

The Freshman: Sawyer
The Juniors: Sari, Zach

In reality, we will keep open ended roles that vary based on the projects and our strong suits.

##### Division of Labor: Similar to group roles, but in this section you should specifically outline how the workload will be distributed among the group members.

We will all try and work the same amount, and distribute the workload based on the assessments we have. 

##### Team Name: What is your team name and what is the rationale behind it?

Convenience Captains
We are all attempting to use our app to drive convenience and further action in the community.

Team Logo:
 What will be your project logo and what is the rationale behind it?

Team Plan: Write your plan for who will do what as you work on the Group Project Proposal.

We will all write the Group Project Proposal as a team, and will spend the appropriate time making it a strong proposal. We will use the advantage of having multiple points of view to edit the writing appropriately.

##### Meeting Management: How often will you meet? How will you coordinate when to meet? How will you communicate to plan meetings? How will the meetings be conducted, what are your expectations for each group member? How will you support each other so that if someone is having a bad day, the meeting can still be successful? How will you make decisions, what happens if people disagree? How will you manage meeting remotely? How will you manage meeting in person if one or more members are remote?

We will meet around once a week together to help further compile and organize our ideas from the allotted class time provided to us to work on our project. If we were to meet remotely, zoom should be sufficient and we can find good times to work together. We will support everyone’s ideas when meeting together to create a safe environment!!

##### Documentation/Accountability: How will you record the pertinent information from a meeting? How will you use each meeting to make an actionable plan for your work and your next meeting? How will you make sure people are held accountable for doing their part?

We will take notes on everyone’s ideas that have been contributed to make an accountable plan for what to work on before the next time we meet. We will also take meeting minutes and establish an email chain to record our process.

##### Rewards/Punishments: How will you motivate yourselves and each other to do your part and deliver the best possible results? What happens if someone fails to meet their commitments? How is success rewarded? How will you respond to failure to adhere to this product? How will you provide each other with helpful and honest feedback without disrupting the process or hurting the team dynamic?

If someone fails to meet commitments, we will give them a stern talking to. 

If a member meets their commitments they will have less work because they already completed it.

Follow-Up: How will you check in with each other to make sure this contract is serving the needs of your team and, in turn, that your team is adhering to the contract? How will you revise the contract, should the need arise? How will you make decisions regarding revisions to the contract? What happens if someone on the team has an issue at any point during the process?

If someone has an issue we can meet about it and discuss a solution, or use the aforementioned email chain to settle out smaller disputes.
