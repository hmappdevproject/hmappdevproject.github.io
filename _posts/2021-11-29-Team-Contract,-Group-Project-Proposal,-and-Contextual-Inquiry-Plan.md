## Team Contract

##### Preliminary Information: Who is in the team, what are their schedules like, any extracurricular commitments requiring extra time, what are everyone’s skill sets, what are people’s general goals with respect to this course and project?

We are a team that focuses on convenience (?) at Horace Mann School through the lens of app development. We have schedules that go from A-H period and extracurriculars some I periods. We have wonderful HM backed skill sets, and we have the goal of making Horace Mann School a better place in terms of community engagement and develop a great application in the process.

##### Guiding Principles: What is the team’s philosophy? What are some ground rules everyone can agree on? What is your mission

In terms of philosophy, we believe that a positive and supportive group environment will better help us do amazing work for the horace mann community. Our mission is to create a more convenient environment in Horace Mann that will better the lifestyle of students and increase community engagement and action. Some ground rules we can all agree on is that we won’t bully the freshman in our group and work evenly on the project. We will also work on not only giving positive feedback but also constructive criticism.

##### Focus on Purpose: What is the purpose of your project? What is your goal – as you begin your project now, what would you like to have accomplished by the end of this project?

The purpose of our project is to help people work together in order to improve the everyday lives of students and facilitate community engagement though everyday convenience.

###### Group Roles: Can be specifically defined for each person or can be general and open-ended

The Freshman: Sawyer
The Juniors: Sari, Zach

In reality, we will keep open ended roles that vary based on the projects and our strong suits.

##### Division of Labor: Similar to group roles, but in this section you should specifically outline how the workload will be distributed among the group members.

We will all try and work the same amount, and distribute the workload based on the assessments we have. 

##### Team Name: What is your team name and what is the rationale behind it?

Convenience Captains
We are all attempting to use our app to drive convenience and further action in the community.

Team Logo:
 What will be your project logo and what is the rationale behind it?

Team Plan: Write your plan for who will do what as you work on the Group Project Proposal.

We will all write the Group Project Proposal as a team, and will spend the appropriate time making it a strong proposal. We will use the advantage of having multiple points of view to edit the writing appropriately.

##### Meeting Management: How often will you meet? How will you coordinate when to meet? How will you communicate to plan meetings? How will the meetings be conducted, what are your expectations for each group member? How will you support each other so that if someone is having a bad day, the meeting can still be successful? How will you make decisions, what happens if people disagree? How will you manage meeting remotely? How will you manage meeting in person if one or more members are remote?

We will meet around once a week together to help further compile and organize our ideas from the allotted class time provided to us to work on our project. If we were to meet remotely, zoom should be sufficient and we can find good times to work together. We will support everyone’s ideas when meeting together to create a safe environment!!

##### Documentation/Accountability: How will you record the pertinent information from a meeting? How will you use each meeting to make an actionable plan for your work and your next meeting? How will you make sure people are held accountable for doing their part?

We will take notes on everyone’s ideas that have been contributed to make an accountable plan for what to work on before the next time we meet. We will also take meeting minutes and establish an email chain to record our process.

##### Rewards/Punishments: How will you motivate yourselves and each other to do your part and deliver the best possible results? What happens if someone fails to meet their commitments? How is success rewarded? How will you respond to failure to adhere to this product? How will you provide each other with helpful and honest feedback without disrupting the process or hurting the team dynamic?

If someone fails to meet commitments, we will give them a stern talking to. 

If a member meets their commitments they will have less work because they already completed it.

Follow-Up: How will you check in with each other to make sure this contract is serving the needs of your team and, in turn, that your team is adhering to the contract? How will you revise the contract, should the need arise? How will you make decisions regarding revisions to the contract? What happens if someone on the team has an issue at any point during the process?

If someone has an issue we can meet about it and discuss a solution, or use the aforementioned email chain to settle out smaller disputes.

## Group Project Proposal:

We all have really busy days, and at Horace Mann it can be really hard to squeeze everyday tasks into our day while we are rushing between buildings and classes. With the little free time we have, it becomes hard and stressful to do the things which should be easiest, from eating enough food, to staying hydrated, to printing out assignments, etc. The difficulty of these tasks drives extra stress in student’s days, meaning that this lack of time ties in to potentially the greatest problem our community faces as a whole: stress, anxiety, and mental health. This, in part, is driven by the inconveniences we face when trying to do things every student has to do in every place. Thus, our group choses to use our time in this App Development class to use convenience as a lens to look at stress at Horace Mann school. While our project may not solve problems relating to classes or otherwise, reducing the time it takes to do essential tasks, even if small, is a unique angle we can use to mitigate the stress a student faces as they go through their days.

In the status quo, as explained a little above, daily tasks at horace mann are not especially convenient. While an example of a convenient system can be found with the quick access to textbooks in the library, a place where many sit down to do their work, this example is not in great company. The cafeteria, the only place in the school to get a water bottle, is downstairs and across campus from the majority of classes, and closed water fountains, as shown in Sawyer’s individual proposal, and a closed field only serve to extrastriate this problem.The library is the only place to print, and that only comes from a desktop computer, which take more time than the passing time a student has to sign into, and in the rush between classes, students without prior knowledge of clubs have little to no way to find their desired meeting. This brings us to the topic of the year long project, community engagement and action. Solving for convenience solves for a little bit of the daily stress a student faces, and stressed students are not in the mood to interact with and improve their community. The lack of time also may drive students to use their break or I period to complete these tasks, two of the only times where the entire community has a chance to interact over grade lines. In an attempt to preserve the only free time we have, we must first eliminate the daily inconveniences that drive us to waste community time in the first place.

## Contextual Inquiry Plan:

Though this problem space of convenience is most impactful on the lives of students, often the busiest with the least free time, we believe that our design will play a role in the lives of teachers and faculty as well. Thus, to gauge effectively how the school feels about this problem space, we plan to interview three people in our community who ideally have unique views on the topic. First, we’d like to interview a busy high school senior or junior at HM. These students both have a lot of work, and have spent enough time in our high school to have a defined view. Second, we’d like to interview a freshman at HM. They often have less work, but also provide a clear contrast between the upper and middle divisions in terms of this problem space. Finally, we’d like to look at one of our teachers, since they are busy in much different ways than students, and also interact with students in different ways. 

To make this feasible in one week, we will likely try to interview two of our friends who have a common free, either outside or in the library, both places with masks on. We can probably reach our friends via a text message, and our teacher with a call. Our role in the interview will most likely be to prompt the students with more open ended questions about recent experiences with inconveniences and their relation to stress at HM. We’d also hope to ask these students about their break and I period activities if applicable. This can likely be done in one week, given that we all have friends who would be willing to speak and have a good amount of fees each week.
