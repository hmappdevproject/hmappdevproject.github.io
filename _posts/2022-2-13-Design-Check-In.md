## Tasks

Diving into the tasks we have identified that may deal with the problem space of inconveniences at Horace Mann, we have identified four current tasks and two new tasks that would be enabled by a design in this space.

To begin with the existing task, we have the challenge of walking to get food. This fits under the categories of food and places, and the desired accomplishment is for students to make it to Fisher Hall and eat their lunch or a snack. This however, can be categorized as a difficult task. The walk from Tillinghast is made harder when the field is closed during winter, and there are large crowds of people that make traversing the pathways harded. As empirical evidence, there are even kids who do not eat lunch at all, as seen in our contextual inquiry.

Our second existing task is allowing students to print documents while in the library within five minutes. This fits into the groups of technology, places, and time, and the main goal for this task is to have printed documents to bring to your classes. We again categorize this task as difficult (depending on the time at your disposal), since logining on the library desktops takes a solid 6 minutes, and only 5 are given between classes. Teachers often ask students to print materials before class, not everyone has a printer at home, and the library can be far away from certain places. We had students during our interviews complain about this inconvenience, and marked it in our affinity diagram. Reducing the time to sign in or print makes this task much easier.

Third, another current task is drinking or getting water during class or between classes, fitting into the group of food. The desired accomplishment is drinking, and we believe that this is a relatively easy task, since even though we asked in our contextual inquiries if people believed it to be inconvenient, even the student who did not eat lunch stayed hydrated. One challenge, however, is that water fountains are closed due to COVID, so students without water bottles cannot get water until their free periods.

Our final current task is charging your phone while at school, fitting in under the theme of technology and miscellaneous issues, with the desired accomplishment being your phone or computer not dying during a long school day. The difficulty on this task ranges based on knowledge, as not everybody has portable charges or knows where the chargers are. If you don’t know where they are, the chargers are not that common or obvious, and even if you do hold the knowledge, chargers often do not work. Further, because the chargers are so short, it is very hard to use your laptop while you are charging it.

Luckily, a potential design would enable some new tasks, the first one being accessing food outside of the cafeteria for lunch, between classes, and during free time, and it falls into the food and location categories. Students desire to accomplish eating and satiating their hunger while simultaneously being productive, but as stated earlier, the cafeteria is often far and few students bring food from home. This task would be much easier, and for people who have a lot of work or no frees (like our student who didn’t eat lunch), this food would take less time to get and be more accessible on the net.

Our second potential new task, and final task of this analysis, is printing from anywhere in school. People seek to easily print documents to bring to class without going to the library and signing into a desktop, and the task falls into the categories surrounding technology and location. This is again much easier than the status quo, since while laptop printing exists, it is difficult given the very little instruction and buggy software. Streamlining this process would make printing take less time, enabling students to print more efficiently and conveniently no matter where they are.

## Designs

Convenience Vending Machine

The design pictured below is a convenience vending machine that can be used around Horace Mann School. Ideally placed in areas around Horace Mann disconnected from the cafeteria, this device will bring daily conveniences hard to access at Horace Mann to the halls of Lutnick and Tillinghast halls. Students will not have to walk all the way around the field to access food or a bottom of water, nor will they have to find a charger and leave their phone there, not knowing when they will be able to come back. The device is easy to use with a touch screen UI with software that compliments the vending machine hardware dispensing devices. Our machine also follows ideals of renewability, demanding charger returns so as to not waste the chargers, and helps people find food and walk to it with flashing lights.

Accessing food outside of the cafeteria - These vending machines will be scattered around the school, so students will be able to get food without walking all around campus to get to the cafeteria. 
Chargers for devices - Portable chargers are offered in this vending machine, so students can easily charge their phones or computers and drop off the chargers at another vending machine at their convenience. The machine will have the software to track who rented the chargers, so the students will be notified if they violate the return time.
Drinking water outside of class - There are also water bottles in this vending machine, therefore helping students stay hydrated throughout the day, even if they forget a water bottle at home.
Walking to find food - Finding food wil be both a much shorter walk and an easier task with these vending machines. They will be in major buildings rather than Fisher’s basement like the cafeteria, and will have flashing lights as a signifier.


Pre-Printing Kiosk

The design drawn below displays a “pre-printing” kiosk that can be put in the halls of major Horace Mann Upper Division buildings like Tillinghast and Lunick halls. The design also displays an accompanying piece of software, called, for the time, preprint.horacemann.org. With it, students will be able to upload a document to the pre-printing network, selecting a location and a period they will pick it up. Whenever anyone shows up to the kiosk, there is a desktop open to our site that shows the submissions for that kiosk, letting one person help print work for everyone who has scheduled it. The kiosk includes sorting folders to make finding your work easy, and it also acts as a hub for other conveniences like water bottles and chargers. The decently large size of a kiosk such as this one will also help make it more noticeable than current locations for printing and for these conveniences.

Printing from anywhere in the school - A kiosk such as this one, combined with our software, will allow students to upload documents from anywhere to a convenient location for their specific schedule. 
Printing in the library within 5 minutes - This software can be used on a desktop in the library such that one computer can be used to print everybody’s work. This removes the main hurdle to printing quickly in the library, the 5 minutes it takes to sign into a desktop.
Drinking water outside of class - Providing water bottles at a “floor hub” like this will help students without water bottles stay hydrated without going to the cafeteria, since they will be positioned in locations closer to their classes.
Chargers for devices - Having chargers at central kiosks will make them much easier to find when compared to the out of the way and discrete locations they have now. 


HM Convenience Map

The design pictured below is a piece of software we will call the “HM Convenience Map.” On the software, users (students or teachers) will be able to first select what they are looking for, be it chargers, printers, water, or food. From that point, the software will show the user the locations for these conveniences all across the school, stating the buildings, floors, and specific locations they can be found in. We hope the visual way of finding these conveniences will be better than the spoken advice or plain searching that place in the status quo. This software can also be placed on communal devices, removing a level of entry to using our program and making these daily tasks easier.

Printing from anywhere in school - This program will help students identify where they can print documents from when not in the library, such as identifying the printing stations in Lutnick.
Accessing food outside of the cafeteria - This design will be updated with whatever food opportunities come up at the school, so it will be helpful for students if they want to find those non-cafeteria food sources.
Walking to find food - This design will highlight the cafeteria and where it is, helping students walk there without having to ask how they get there and with less risk of getting lost.
Chargers for devices - Our map will tell students where phone chargers are, spreading knowledge of their information when students are in need.
Drinking water outside of class - The map can highlight water bottle sources and water fountains, allowing students to more efficiently find the place where they will get hydrated.
