## Introduction:
  As the Convenience Captains we set out on our mission to solve the greatest problems relating to convenience, or rather inconvenience, at Horace Mann by first brainstorming. Once we had a solid idea of potential issues in the space, we decided to observe and then interview potential users of a design - two students and a teacher - in our contextual inquiry. From that review, we gathered a lot of first hand data on how people treat issues of convenience, and finally, we came up with groupings, or themes, for each of those observations, including headings for Time, Places, Food, Technology, and Miscellaneous items. Our affinity diagram displays a visual representation of our findings, and will help us brainstorm important tasks that students at HM face for which our group can design.

## Tasks
  Diving into the tasks we have identified that may deal with the problem space of inconveniences at Horace Mann, we have identified four current tasks and two new tasks that would be enabled by a design in this space.

To begin with the existing task, we have the challenge of walking to the cafeteria for lunch. This fits under the categories of food and places, and the desired accomplishment is for students to make it to Fisher Hall and eat their lunch. This however, can be categorized as a difficult task. The walk from Tillinghast is made harder when the field is closed during winter, and there are large crowds of people that make traversing the pathways harded. As empirical evidence, there are even kids who do not eat lunch at all, as seen in our contextual inquiry.

Our second existing task is printing documents during passing time (or in general). This fits into the groups of technology, places, and time, and the main goal for this task is to have printed documents to bring to your classes. We again categorize this task as difficult (depending on the time at your disposal), since logining on the library desktops takes a solid 6 minutes, and only 5 are given between classes. Teachers often ask students to print materials before class, not everyone has a printer at home, and the library can be far away from certain places. We had students during our interviews complain about this inconvenience, and marked it in our affinity diagram.

Third, another current task is drinking or getting water during class or between classes, fitting into the group of food. The desired accomplishment is drinking, and we believe that this is a relatively easy task, since even though we asked in our contextual inquiries if people believed it to be inconvenient, even the student who did not eat lunch stayed hydrated. One challenge, however, is that water fountains are closed due to COVID, so students without water bottles cannot get water until their free periods.

Our final current task is charging your phone while at school, fitting in under the theme of technology and miscellaneous issues, with the desired accomplishment being your phone or computer not dying during a long school day. The difficulty on this task ranges based on knowledge, as not everybody has portable charges or knows where the chargers are. If you don’t know where they are, the chargers are not that common or obvious, and even if you do hold the knowledge, chargers often do not work. Further, because the chargers are so short, it is very hard to use your laptop while you are charging it.

Luckily, a potential design would enable some new tasks, the first one being accessing food outside of the cafeteria for lunch, between classes, and during free time, and it falls into the food and location categories. Students desire to accomplish eating and satiating their hunger while simultaneously being productive, but as stated earlier, the cafeteria is often far and few students bring food from home. This task would be much easier, and for people who have a lot of work or no frees (like our student who didn’t eat lunch), this food would take less time to get and be more accessible on the net.

Our second potential new task, and final task of this analysis, is printing from laptops during passing time. People seek to easily print documents to bring to class without signing into a library desktop, and the task falls into the categories surrounding technology and location. This is again much easier than the status quo, since while laptop printing exists, it is difficult given the very little instruction and buggy software. Streamlining this process would make printing take less time, enabling students to print during passing time and potentially outside of the library.
