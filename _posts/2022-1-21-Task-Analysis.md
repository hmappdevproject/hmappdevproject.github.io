As the Convenience Captains we set out on our mission to solve the greatest problems relating to convenience, or rather inconvenience, at Horace Mann by first brainstorming. Once we had a solid idea of potential issues in the space, we decided to observe and then interview potential users of a design - two students and a teacher - in our contextual inquiry. From that review, we gathered a lot of first hand data on how people treat issues of convenience, and finally, we came up with groupings, or themes, for each of those observations, including headings for Time, Places, Food, Technology, and Miscellaneous items. Our affinity diagram displays a visual representation of our findings, and will help us brainstorm important tasks that students at HM face for which our group can design.

Diving into the tasks we have identified that may deal with the problem space of inconveniences at Horace Mann, we have identified four current tasks and two new tasks that would be enabled by a design in this space.
